## 1. Introduction

The Enhanced Dark Souls Knowledge Graph System is a **state-of-the-art, end-to-end pipeline** designed to **scrape, extract, model, analyze, and interact with** the lore and data from the Dark Souls universe. By leveraging modern NLP, graph theory, and AI, this project transforms the vast unstructured content of [Dark Souls Wikidot](http://darksouls.wikidot.com/) into a rich, explorable knowledge graph.  
It supports everything from parallelized scraping and advanced entity extraction to graph analytics, LLM-powered interactive Q&A, and seamless export to formats suitable for databases and data science.

This README provides a **comprehensive, step-by-step breakdown** of the system’s architecture, workflow, modules, features, extensibility, and troubleshooting, serving both as user guide and developer reference.

## 2. Workflow Overview

### High-level Pipeline

1. **Scraping**
   - All major Dark Souls categories (weapons, bosses, NPCs, areas, etc.) and their subcategories are discovered and scraped in parallel.
   - Each wiki page is cleaned and extracted as raw text.

2. **NLP Processing**
   - Spacy and NLTK power custom entity recognition (e.g., weapons, locations, factions) and relationship extraction (lore verbs, item possession, affiliations, etc.).
   - Sentiment, temporal expressions, co-occurrences, and character attributes are detected.
   - Raw data is transformed into structured entities and relationships.

3. **Knowledge Graph Construction**
   - Entities and relationships are modeled as nodes and edges in a NetworkX graph.
   - Node/edge attributes include type, category, sentiment, and provenance.
   - The graph is cached for fast reloads.

4. **Graph Analysis**
   - Multiple centrality metrics (betweenness, closeness, degree, pagerank, eigenvector) are calculated.
   - Community detection algorithms identify tightly-knit groups (e.g., factions).
   - Graph statistics (density, clustering, connected components, diameter) are computed.
   - Shortest path and neighborhood queries allow for exploration of connections.

5. **AI-Powered Q&A**
   - LangChain and OpenAI GPT enable natural language querying of the graph.
   - The system interprets questions, reasons over the graph, and provides human-readable answers about lore, relationships, importance, etc.
   - The CLI maintains conversational context and memory.

6. **Export**
   - All processed data is exported in multiple formats: Excel (multi-sheet), CSV (by category and relationship type), JSON (analysis reports), and Cypher (for Neo4j import).
   - A comprehensive ZIP archive bundles all outputs for easy sharing and downstream analysis.

## 3. File & Module Breakdown

A modular architecture promotes **clarity, scalability, and extensibility**. Here’s what each major file does:

### Scraping Modules

- **data_scrape.py**
  - Central hub for discovering and scraping category/subcategory pages.

## 4. Data Flow & Pipeline Details

### 1. Category Definitions

- All primary Dark Souls lore categories are mapped to their Wikidot URLs—Weapons, Armor, NPCs, Bosses, Locations, Spells, etc.
- Allows for **scalable extension** to new categories or other games.

### 2. Parallel Scraping

- Discovery of subcategories and page links within each category.
- ThreadPoolExecutor maximizes efficiency by running multiple HTTP requests in parallel.
- Scraped content is cleaned (removal of HTML tags, scripts, images, etc.) and saved to CSV files.

### 3. NLP Extraction

- Spacy is initialized with custom matchers for game-specific entities, enabling recognition of items, locations, and more.
- NLTK provides stopword removal, tokenization, and sentiment lexicon analysis.
- The system extracts:
  - Named entities (PERSON, ORG, LOC, etc.)
  - Relationships via dependency parsing and custom lore/action verbs
  - Item possession, faction membership, and hierarchical structures
  - Sentiment (positive/negative/neutral context)
  - Temporal expressions (chronology of events)
  - Character attributes and co-occurrences
  - Dialogue (quoted text)

### 4. Graph Building

- Entities and relationships are compiled into master CSVs.
- NetworkX graph is constructed, with metadata-rich nodes and edges.
- Graph is cached (pickle) to speed up future loads.
- Node attributes: entity type, category, subcategory, sentiment.
- Edge attributes: relationship type, predicate, provenance.

### 5. Graph Analytics

- **Centrality**: Identifies key entities in the lore network.
- **Community Detection**: Finds tightly-linked groups, revealing factions or interconnected storylines.
- **Graph Statistics**: Density, clustering, connected components, diameter, average shortest path.
- **Shortest Path**: Explores connections between any two entities.
- **Degree**: Shows most influential or well-connected characters/items.

### 6. AI & Q&A

- LangChain wraps the knowledge graph as a tool, connecting to OpenAI GPT for natural language Q&A.
- The system can answer questions like:
  - "Who is the most important boss?"
  - "Show all knights in Anor Londo."
  - "What is the shortest path between Solaire and Gwyn?"
  - "List all relationships involving the Lordvessel."
- Maintains conversational history and context in the CLI.

### 7. Export

    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```
- **Memory issues**:
  - Lower max_workers or chunk sizes in scraping/graph building.
  - Try processing smaller subsets of data.
- **Neo4j import**:
  - Ensure Neo4j server is running and accessible.
  - Review Cypher files for schema compatibility.
